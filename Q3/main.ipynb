      "Text: moreover it is relatively robust against insertions and deletions which frequently occur in v3  | Number of tokens: 14\n",
      "Text: the approach could help clinicians to find optimal personalized treatments and it offers new insights into the molecular basis of co receptor usage  | Number of tokens: 23\n",
      "Text: for instance it quantifies the importance for co receptor usage of a pocket that probably is responsible for binding sulfated tyrosine introduction  | Number of tokens: 22\n",
      "Text: specific protein interactions are central to biological processes and the infection of cells with viruses is no exception there  | Number of tokens: 19\n",
      "Text: in the case of pathogenic viruses such protein interactions are potential targets for medical intervention  | Number of tokens: 15\n",
      "Text: an example of particularly high relevance is human immunodeficiency virus 1  | Number of tokens: 11\n",
      "Text: hiv1 enters human cells in a process that comprises several steps including the binding of the viral gp120 protein to the cellular receptor protein cd4 and a co receptor protein usually one of the two chemokine receptors ccr5 and cxcr4 citation  | Number of tokens: 41\n",
      "Text: the type of co receptor used by the virus the so called co receptor tropism has a prognostic value since patients with a cxcr4 tropic virus progress faster to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome compared to patients with a ccr5 tropic virus citation  | Number of tokens: 41\n",
      "Text: in addition to the purely x4 and r5 tropic viruses there are also dual tropic strains able to use both co receptors  | Number of tokens: 22\n",
      "Text: recently the first drug that binds to ccr5 and thus inhibits productive binding of gp120 has been approved by regulatory authorities in several countries  | Number of tokens: 24\n",
      "Text: this has made the determination of co receptor tropism directly relevant to anti retroviral treatment as ccr5 inhibitors are of course inactive against x4 virus  | Number of tokens: 25\n",
      "Text: the standard way of determining co receptor tropism is by cell based assays citation citation  | Number of tokens: 15\n",
      "Text: the main drawbacks of these assays are that they are currently only carried out by a handful of specialized laboratories worldwide and that the overall procedure typically takes several weeks  | Number of tokens: 30\n",
      "Text: these impediments to the wide application of entry inhibitors could be overcome by an approach similar to genotypic drug resistance testing citation where drug resistance of a viral strain is inferred from comparison of mutational patterns obtained from sequencing parts of the genome of that strain with patterns of validated resistance mutations  | Number of tokens: 52\n",
      "Text: this is a relatively fast and cheap standard procedure established in many clinics  | Number of tokens: 13\n",
      "Text: at first glance genotypic testing for co receptor tropism seems to be possible since the main molecular determinant of tropism is known to be the third variable loop of the viral glycoprotein gp120 citation a peptide stretch of about 35 amino acids with a disulfide bridge connecting the terminal cysteins  | Number of tokens: 50\n",
      "Text: unfortunately as suggested by its name v3 is notorious for its high sequence variability citation including also some variability in length and this has made it difficult to use it as a basis for genotypic co receptor tropism testing  | Number of tokens: 39\n",
      "Text: nevertheless the relevance of the quest has prompted many groups to develop models that link properties of v3 to co receptor tropism  | Number of tokens: 22\n",
      "Text: the importance of electrostatics for co receptor tropism has been recognized early on and the best known model the so called 1125 rule refers to charges of v3 residues 11 and 25 if one of these is positive then the virus is cxcr4 tropic citation citation  | Number of tokens: 46\n",
      "Text: this rule has a specificity of more than 09 but only a low to moderate sensitivity of about 04 06 depending on the test data which is not satisfactory for routine clinical application  | Number of tokens: 33\n",
      "Text: to improve predictions from sequence several groups have applied machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks citation position specific scoring matrices citation decision trees or support vector machines citation  | Number of tokens: 30\n",
      "Text: still prediction accuracies fall short of what seems reasonable for regular clinical use citation  | Number of tokens: 14\n",
      "Text: it is unclear whether the limited accuracies are the footprint of tropism determinants outside v3 or the consequence of model imperfections  | Number of tokens: 21\n",
      "Text: a milestone for the understanding of co receptor tropism was the x ray structure of gp120 with the v3 loop in a biological context citation  | Number of tokens: 25\n",
      "Text: this paved the way for the development of prediction methods that use in addition to v3 sequence structural information  | Number of tokens: 19\n",
      "Text: to our knowledge the first of these methods has been that of sander et al citation which was mainly based on geometric distances of amino acid pairs within the structure of v3  | Number of tokens: 32\n",
      "Text: although our method detailed in the following relies on the same experimental structure by huang et al citation it differs from that of sander et al in several respects eg it deals with indels and perhaps most crucially it uses as descriptors properties that directly determine interaction of v3 with the co receptors  | Number of tokens: 53\n",
      "Text: by the latter we consider a seemingly trivial but fundamental fact that so far has not been thoroughly exploited although v3 is highly variable all x4 tropic v3 loops share one property namely they preferentially have a physical binding interaction with cxcr4 while r5 tropic v3 loops preferably interacts with ccr5  | Number of tokens: 51\n",
      "Text: the accuracy of the method makes it attractive as clinical tool for patient tailored decisions on treatment with entry inhibitors and it suggests that co receptor tropism can be explained almost exclusively based on v3  | Number of tokens: 35\n"

In SciPy 1.11.0, this behavior will change: the default value of `keepdims` will become False, the `axis` over which the statistic is taken will be eliminated, and the value None will no longer be accepted. Set `keepdims` to True or False to avoid this warning.\n",
